# Security-Headers-Checker

Title: Security Headers Checker

Description:
The Security Headers Checker is a Python script designed to automate the process of checking the security headers of a website. Security headers play a crucial role in enhancing the security posture of web applications by providing additional layers of protection against common security vulnerabilities. This script sends a GET request to the specified URL, retrieves the response headers, and checks if the expected security headers are present and configured correctly according to predefined values.

Key Features:
- Automates the process of checking security headers for a given website.
- Validates the presence and configuration of common security headers.
- Provides clear results indicating the status of each security header check.

Usage:
1. Install Python if not already installed on your system.
2. Install the `requests` library by running `pip install requests` in your terminal.
3. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script (`python security_headers_check.py`) and enter the URL of the website to check when prompted.
5. View the results of the security headers check, indicating whether each expected header is present and configured correctly.
